To update your GitHub repository with changes from your local system, follow these steps:

1. **Make Changes Locally**:
   - Modify, add, or delete files in your local repository as needed.

2. **Stage the Changes**:
   - Add the changes to the staging area with the `git add` command. This prepares the files for committing.
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - You can specify individual files instead of `.` if you only want to add specific changes.

3. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Commit the staged changes to your local repository with a descriptive message.
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
     ```

4. **Push the Changes to GitHub**:
   - Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository on the `master` branch (or `main`, if you're using that).
     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```

Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin master
```

This process updates the `master` branch of your GitHub repository with the changes made in your local repository. If you need to make changes to another branch, replace `master` with the appropriate branch name.
